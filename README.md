test task for kottans js courses

===================
About myself: 
My name is Andrii Chubariev, this summer graduated as master of physics in Taras Shevchenko NU of Kiev. Currently I'm working as junior .Net developer at GlobalLogic, total experience is over 1 year.

I have no vast experience in js, just run through some web guides like learn.javascrip.ru and Hexlet video lessons (which are both realy nice). As a result my oppinion is - sure thing js differs from traditional compile languages and some its parts, like closures, despite looking like bug-o-features are indeed deep and smart.

So from your course I expect to hear again all about js from experienced people and get in modern awesome looking and proper patterns implementing  js libs.

Hope to receive your invitation.

PS: I do want to visit every lesson from start to end, and not going to vanish in the middle of the course. Firstly becouse of it is clear that organizators invest a lot to them and secondary the last 3 lessons seems most intetesting for me.
